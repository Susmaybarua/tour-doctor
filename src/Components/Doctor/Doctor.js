            <p>Unless you've been blessed with a perfectly regular digestive system regardless of what you eat, you probably know that what goes into your body has a huge impact on what comes out of it—and that it could exacerbate constipation.

But before you start limiting your diet to water and prunes, let's make something clear: Just because something is on this list, or just because you ate something while you were constipated and it didn't help you go to the bathroom, doesn't mean you need to avoid it at all costs.

"What happens to people when they get constipated, they start implicating every food, because every food starts to bother them, the worse the constipation gets," Elana Maser, MD, assistant professor of gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and gastroenterologist at the Feinstein IBD Center at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, tells Health. 

But constipation isn't usually connected to only one food—instead, it's the combination of food (or other lifestyle or genetic factors) that's slowing down your bowels. "Sometimes people end up limiting their diet to two or three things because they think they can't tolerate anything else, but really their bowel motion just needs to be managed," says Dr. Maser. "Once their bowels move more successfully, they can tolerate more foods."

Sometimes, constipation is even linked to a lack of certain foods or nutrients in your diet—mainly fiber, a type of carbohydrate that your body can't fully digest (and thus, moves through your digestive system relatively intact, essentially making your bowels do what they were designed to do). For example, it's not that, say, dairy is necessarily wreaking havoc on your digestive system—it's just that the cheese boards and milkshakes haven't given your colon enough fiber to work with.

Here, gastroenterologists weigh in on the top foods—along with some lifestyle factors—that can slow down your digestive system, leading to constipation and infrequent bathroom trips. Keep in mind: Just because something backed you up—like last night's ice cream cone or this morning's extra-creamy coffee—it doesn't mean you have to cut it out of your diet completely. But if particular foods tend to give you bathroom troubles repeatedly, it's worthwhile to consider cutting back a bit for your stomach's sake. </p>
